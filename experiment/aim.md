### To acquaint the knowledge of various thermal models considering conduction mode of heat transfer; and a comparative study to estimate crater depth, profile due to heat source

### Objective
1. To study various accepted thermal models in Electrical Discharge Machining process
2. To understand the effect of variation of pulse time, leading towards variation in desired output in context with various thermal models
3. To acquire knowledge regarding erosion characteristics in EDM
4. To study the temperature distribution along the crater depth
